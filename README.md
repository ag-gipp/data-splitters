The `splitter.sh` expects to arguments, the input and output folder.
For example, if your data is in `data` and you want to put into `out`:
```sh
./splitter data out
```

The `data` directory should have the structure:
```
- data
   |- dataset1
   |    |- lang1
   |    |- lang2
   |- dataset2
   |    |- lang1
   |    |- lang2
   . . .
   . . .
   . . .
```
